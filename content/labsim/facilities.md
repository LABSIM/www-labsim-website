The core of the LABSIM is mainly to provide a simulation software environment but our competencies are actually materialized around 3 physical means.

#### 1. PYCSHEL

> *"Prototyping & conception of systems for helicopters"*

This bench stand for **P**rotot**Y**ping & **C**onception of **S**ystems for **HEL**icopter. It allows the researcher to design, prototype and test systems for Helicopters. It is composed of a CAVE for immersive display, four tactile-screen  for avionics and two seated cockpit : one with passive helicopters sticks and another one with active side-sticks.

#### 2. SCHEME

> *"Prototyping bench for innovative interfaces "*

This bench is composed of a cylindrical 180° immersive display & a single operator station. It is primary used to design/prototype new interaction means & study the subject behavior & cognitive state through bio-physiological metric such as eye-tracking, mo-cap, ECG, EMG, EEG & GSR. Moreover, this bench is the LABSIM hybrid-reality bridge to real-world UAV.

#### 3. LIPS

> *"Laboratory for pilot/system interaction studies"*

This laboratory is mainly used for the human-system interaction studies. It allows the interaction of up to 10 operators (ATC’s, pilots, UAV payload operators, UAV pilots,…) in a complex scenario with up to 128 vehicles. It grant the possibility to study the interactions between the operators and the systems or between the different operators.
