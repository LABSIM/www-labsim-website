# Capabilities

---

Following the VR principles, the LABSIM capabilities can be dived as 3 categories :

### 1. Sensory-motor devices : *"Exploring next-gen piloting interfaces"*

  - Wittenstein (C) active side-sticks for flight envelop protection & obstacke avoidance
  - multi-touch devices with up to ten touch-points
  - Haption Virtuose (C) 6-dimensional robot arm for disruptive interaction means
  - hand free gesture captue through LeapMotion (C) devices
  - AR & VR head-mounted display


### 2. Biophysical Sensors : *"Quantifying & modeling the human behavior"*

  - Optirack (C) 120Hz infra-red based mo-cap device
  - SmartEye (C) binocular 120hZ eye-tracker
  - Biopac (C) with 16 channels : EEG, EMG, ECG, GSR, force sensor
  - BrainVision (C)  96 channels EEG system


### 3. Expert Models : *"Modelling the flight behaviour with high fidelity"*

  - ART FlightLab (C) (aircraft, rotorcraft, UAV's)
  - ship deck modeling
  - flight control systems
  - generic avionics models
  - & more ...

# Facilities

---

First of all, every facilities can all work simultaneously in shared scenarios trough the LABSIM Software Simulation Ecosystem. Actually, we maintain three physical means :

### 1. PYCSHEL - prototyping & conceptions of systems for helicopters

This bench stand for **P**rotot**Y**ping & **C**onception of **S**ystems for **HEL**icopter. It allows the researcher to design, prototype and test systems for Helicopters. It is composed of a CAVE for immersive display, four tactile-screen  for avionics and two seated cockpit : one with passive helicopeters sticks and another one with active side-sticks.

### 2. SCHEME - prototyping bench for innovative interfaces

This bench is composed of a cylindrical 180° immersive display & a single operator station. It is primary used to design/prototype new interaction means & study the subject behaviour & cognitive state through bio-physiological metric such as *eye-tracking, mo-cap, ECG, EMG, EEG & GSR...* Moreover, this bench is the LABSIM hybrid-reality bridge to real-world UAV.

### 3. LIPS - laboratory for pilot/system interaction studies

This laboratory is mainly used for the human-system interaction studies. It allows the interaction of up to 10 operators (ATC’s, pilots, UAV payload operators, UAV pilots,…) in a complex scenario with up to 128 vehicles. It grant the possibility to study the interactions between the operators and the systems or between the different operators
