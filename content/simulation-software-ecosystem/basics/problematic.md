> *How to allow fast & early conception/evaluation cycle of innovative concept in situ ?*

This was the motivation of the very first development of the LABSIM's Simulation Software Environment. Our answer to solve the *ditto* problematic. Because Research area is a very versatile environment, we start only from this. No requirements at all.

So we begin by a simple term-by-term analysis of this problematic which will finally lead to a set of requirements to met with our SSE.

*Let's begin*.
